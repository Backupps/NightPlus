# NightPlus
Night+ is a client made by JumpDelay, the client is free, its reliable and mainly focuses on Blocksmc.
it has some decent bypasses.
# Whats the catch?
The issue is im a student, so i cant update the client regularly.
# Why is there no src????
i always have issues with IntelIjj, im not sure if ill even be able to release the client. Its not obfuscated it can be imported with a decompiler.
